# Unit 2
## Web Fundamentals

---

class: center, middle

# [Class 4](https://education.launchcode.org/web-fundamentals/class-prep/4/) Lecture

---

### General Reminders

- You MUST do the Class Prep
- Code with the videos
- Follow the curriculum
- HTML-Me-Something due today
- Web Caesar due January 24
- Use Slack to communicate (Download the app!)

---

### Some Clarifications

- `open index.html` or `start index.html` open a file on your machine. 
- `python main.py` (given main.py is a Flask app) starts a web app at `localhost:5000`.
- Why can't I see my new file in VSCode?

## Studio Solution
### [Flicklist 1](https://education.launchcode.org/web-fundamentals/studios/flicklist/1/)

---

### Studio 1: Self-Led Walkthrough
- `cd lc101/flicklist-flask`
- If not on `walkthrough1` branch: `git checkout walkthrough1`
- `source activate hello-flask`
- `python main.py`

---

### Studio 1: Solution
- `git checkout studio1`
- `git pull origin studio1` (Why?)
- `code .`
- Complete TODOs (Run the app to watch changes)
- `git add .`
- `git commit -m "Your message here"`
- Why don't we push? 
- Can we push to our own if we want?

---
### Topics
- HTML Forms
- Forms in Flask
- GET versus POST Methods
- Status Codes
- Form inputs 
- `str.foramt`

---

### GET Methods
- Parameters are in the URL (`https://www.google.com/?q=puppies`)
- Should be used only to fetch documents
- Should NOT change state of data on server

---

### POST Methods
- Parameters in the request body
- Used to update data on the server or in the database
- Can change state of data on the server

---

### GET Methods: Some Gotchas

## Studio Walkthrough
### [Flicklist 2](https://education.launchcode.org/web-fundamentals/studios/flicklist/2/)

---

### Studio Walkthrough
- Our goal is to have a running list of movies watched
- Eventually we will add a database
- This allows us to add, delete, change a movie's status to 'watched', etc.
- Start this journey by completely restructuing the code to have a form to add movies.
- The goal of this studio is to add a form so we can add movies to a list.
- Note: We won't actually add anything to a list. Just going through the motions for now. 

---

### Studio Walkthrough
- `cd lc101/flicklist-flask`
- `git status` (add and commit if necessary)
- `git checkout walkthrough2`
- `code .`
- Note the answer to the previous studio
- Restruture the code (code along or just watch)
- Add and commit when complete (if you code along)
- Starter code (solution to walkthrough2) available on the `studio2` branch
