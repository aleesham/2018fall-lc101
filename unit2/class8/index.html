### SQL
- Do not think linearly. For example,

<div class="med-img">
    <img alt="SQL query" src="../images/sql.png" />
</div>

- `JOIN` is first 
- `WHERE` is next 
- `SELECT`is last

# Questions?

---

### User Signup: How in the heck do I do this?!
- WRITE (like, on paper) an outline. For example:
    - First, get the form to display. 
    - Then, get the POST endpoint working.
    - Then, deal with validation.
- This is not the ONLY 'outline'. Just a suggestion.
- Write helper functions to help you if you would like! 
    - `isValidPassword`? `isValidUsername`? Etc.

---

### User Signup: How in the heck do I do this?!
- You can breakdown your steps into small pieces, too!
-Example: for "get the form to display"
    - Build app that displays "test" at `localhost:5000/`
    - Build `base.html` template
    - Build `form.html` template
    - Edit our web app to display our `form.html`
