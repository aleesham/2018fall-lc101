### Topics

- HTTP
- Creating a Web App with Flask

---

### HTTP
- Example: GET https://www.google.com responds with the html which displays the homepage
- Let us check this out using our Dev Tools.

---

### Web App/HTTP(S) Demo
- Open a web browser
- Open dev tools and go to the network tab
- Navigate to https://www.google.com
    - Click the www.google.com call in your network tab
    - Click on the headers tabs

---
### Web App/HTTP(S) Demo
- (Don't code, just watch here)
    - cURL command from terminal
    - "Teach" my Linux command line cURL
    - curl http://google.com
    - curl https://google.com

---

### Flask
- A python framework for making web apps
- A web app is a program on a server that creates html in respone to user actions
- What is the difference between static webpages and dynamic webpages? Examples?

---

### What is a Python Framework?
- Python files already written that we use
- It does something useful
- It has rules/conventions
- It has functions/Classes we can use
- Check out the docs [here](http://flask.pocoo.org/)

---

### Some Commands from the Tutorial
- `conda` is a command we "taught" our terminal during the `initials.py` assignment
- Think of the Miniconda software as a python package installer
- `conda create -n hello-flask`
    - Creates a virtual environment
    - What exactly is a virutal environment?
    - Used to control dependencies/versions

    <img alt="virutal environments" src="../images/virtual-env.png" />
</div>

---

### Some Commands from the Tutorial
- `source activate hello-flask`
- `conda install flask` 
- Why don't we have to:
    - `conda install math`?
    - `conda install random`?

---

### Some Commands from the Tutorial
- What happens when we run `python main.py` (from Class Prep)?
- What shows up in the terminal?
- Let's run these commands and do another example...

---

### Demo
- Create a new project directory in your `lc101` folder 
- Create a new environment using `conda`
- Activate your environment
- Install `flask` in your enviroment
- Make a web app
- Run the app

### [Flicklist 1](https://education.launchcode.org/web-fundamentals/studios/flicklist/1/)

---

### Studio Walkthrough
- Navigate to your `lc101` folder
- Clone the [flicklisk-flask project](https://github.com/LaunchCodeEducation/flicklist-flask)
- Now we have a local copy!
- Remember, we need to `cd flicklist-flask` to access it.
- Good luck!
