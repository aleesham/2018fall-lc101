# Chapter 10 Lecture
## Lists

---

### Topics

- Mutability
- Methods
- Referencing
- Aliasing versus Cloning
- List Comprehensions
- `split` and `join`

---

### Mutability
- What does it mean for something to be mutable?
- Are strings mutable?
- Let's do some examples from the command line!


---

### Methods
- [Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html)
- We will see some examples later

---

### Referencing

- Lists are actually made up of references to other objects
- This causes us to have different ideas of equality: `==` and `is`
- How are these equalities different?

```
a = [1,2,3]
b = [1,2,3]
c = a

print(a == b)
print(a is b)
print(a is c)
```
- What is the output?

---

<img alt="List references" src="../images/lists1.png" />

---

### Aliasing versus Cloning
- Aliasing creates a reference to the same list
- Cloning creates a copy of the list

```
a = [1,2,3]
b = a[:]
c = a

print(a is b)
print(a is c)
```
- What us the output?

---

<img alt="List references" src="../images/lists1.png" />

---
 
### List Comprehensions
- These are my favorite!
- Given a list of numbers, make a new list of each odd numbers square.
- Example:
    - List given: `[1,2,3,4,5]`
    - List created: `[1,9,25]`

---

### `split` and `join`
- Example:
    - `x = "1, 2, 3, 4"`
    - `x.split(", ")`
    - `words = ["Hi", "how", "are", "you"]`
    - `words.join(" ")`

---

## Studio Walkthrough
### [Bugz](https://runestone.launchcode.org/runestone/static/thinkcspy/Studios/bugz.html)

---

### TA-Led Activity: Pair-programming
- [What is it?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYBjVTMUQY0)
- Two programmers working together at one station
- One drives, the other(s) navigates as each line of code is typed
- The navigator problem solves as the driver types
- Teams will switch roles frequently (frequency depends on team)
- (Sometimes, both drive one machine together)
