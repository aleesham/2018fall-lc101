# Chapter 9 Lecture
## Strings

---

### Topics

- Methods
- Looping and Counting
---

### Methods
- [Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#text-sequence-type-str)
- Examples:
    - `count`
    - `find`
    - `replace`
    - `format`
    - `index`

---

### Looping and Counting
- We can loop through a string:
    - directly using each character
    - indirectly using index
- Exercises/Studio will show each technique
- Is one better than the other? 

---

### Chapter 9 Exercises

- [Chapter 9](https://runestone.launchcode.org/runestone/static/thinkcspy/Strings/Exercises.html)
    - 4
    - 5
    - 7

---

### Chapter 9 Assignment Clarification
- Do some research on `is_alpha`
- Only three of the six tests will pass when you have finished. It depends on whether you use string concatenation or `str.format`
---

### 'Initials' Assignment Clarification
- Start this NOW. You have all the tools to solve this problem today.
- You need to read VERY carefully.
- Windows Users: If you ever open PowerShell, you have not read carefully enough.
