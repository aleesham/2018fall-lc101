## Validation

---

## Why Validate Form Data?

- Ensure that user-submitted data "makes sense"

--

- Prevent users from submitting data that might break our application

--

- Provide user-friendly feedback when data doesn't meet our criteria

---

## Client-side Validation

### How?

- HTML input element attributes
- JavaScript

--

**Advantages:** Data can be validated in "real time" without having to make a request to the server. This is much more user-friendly.

--

**Disadvangates:** Client-side validation can be easily by-passed by disabling JS or by submitting a request without using the form you've written.

---

## Server-side Validation

### How?

- Within request handlers
- Within model classes

--

**Advantages:** Can not be bypassed.

--

**Disadvangates:** Is not user-friendly since a request has to be submitted in order to have data validated.

---

## Where to Validate?

**Question:** If both client-side and server-side validation have downsides, then what is the best approach to validation?

--

**Answer:** Validate everywhere! Each of these validation locations have differing strengths and weaknesses, and in general, each should be used in a multi-faceted approach to data validation.

When any one part of your application is receiving data from a user, you should **never** assume that it will be valid and safe, even if you have validation measures in place elsewhere.
